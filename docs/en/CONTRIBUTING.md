# Strayex Contributing

If you want to support me in contribution, here is instruction on how to do that!

## Pull Request

Requests for adding code are held on GitHub repository.
If you want to add code to Strayex, repair or upgrade existing code, and add some text to documentation,
clone repository from GitHub, add your changes and push Pull Request.
I will try at least once a week check PRs.
When I will reject PR I will always give reason for that.

### How to prepare Pull Request

To accept PR by me, the following list have to be fulfilled:

- code should be yours, if it's not, it have to be on open source license permited to republish, X11 the best,
- if code is not yours, add source link and copyright header,
- code shoud be readable, formated (TABs, lines separators), comments really welcome,
- if you add new function to system, it will be really nice to update the documentation about that ("docs" directory).
- update "CONTRIBUTORS.md", adding informations about yourself to file based on template,

### Documentation contribution

To add Strayex Docs translation, create folder with name of language's shortcut (for example "sc" - Chzech, "es" - Spanish).
In this folder have to be this list of files:

- README.md - informations on how to read documentation,
- CONTRIBUTING.md - how to become project's contributor,
- START.md - how to start working with system,
- BASIC.md - basic system info, functionality description,
- ADVANCED.md - advanced system's info (API, detailed system's architecture, tips),

When you translate documentation, base on English version to avoid lose of original content in translations.
Update "CONTRIBUTORS.md", like in normal Pull Request(look upper).
